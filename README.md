# OpenDict
A joke script to "translate" a sentence by searching Linguee.com for every individual word and smashing the result together. Get ready to get your IP address banned by Linguee! I did (temporarily).

## Usage
Run `python main.py`, enter the sentence to translate at the prompt, and watch Google harass Linguee.com. Runs on Selenium, so you'd need the proper driver and everything.
